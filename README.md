Unfortunatly, I spent hours trying to figure out Github pages, and Netlify, but nothing worked
(netfly: https://main--cheery-bombolone-d21a8c.netlify.app/)

So here are the steps to run the website using local-host:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open cmd
3. cd to the repository's location
4. run "npm install react-router-dom"
5. run "npm start"
